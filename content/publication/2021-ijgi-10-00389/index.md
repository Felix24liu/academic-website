abstract: The use of social media data provided powerful data support to reveal the spatiotemporal characteristics and mechanisms of human activity, as it integrated rich spatiotemporal and textual semantic information. However, previous research has not fully utilized its semantic and spatiotemporal information, due to its technical and algorithmic limitations. The efficiency of the deep mining of textual semantic resources was also low. In this research, a multi-classification of text model, based on natural language processing technology and the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) framework is constructed. The residents’ activities in Beijing were then classified using the Sina Weibo data in 2019. The results showed that the accuracy of the classifications was more than 90%. The types and distribution of residents’ activities were closely related to the characteristics of the activities and holiday arrangements. From the perspective of a short timescale, the activity rhythm on weekends was delayed by one hour as compared to that on weekdays. There was a significant agglomeration of residents’ activities that presented a spatial co-location cluster pattern, but the proportion of balanced co-location cluster areas was small. The research demonstrated that location conditions, especially the microlocation condition (the distance to the nearest subway station), were the driving factors that affected the resident activity cluster patterns. In this research, the proposed framework integrates textual semantic analysis, statistical method, and spatial techniques, broadens the application areas of social media data, especially text data, and provides a new paradigm for the research of residents’ activities and spatiotemporal behavior.
